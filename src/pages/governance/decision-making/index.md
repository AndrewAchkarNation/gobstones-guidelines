# Decision Making

Currently, the project decision making is handled by a [**Core Team**](../core-team) of researchers and developers that currently take all major decisions regarding the language and the environments, thus providing direction, defining the metrics for validating impacts to the project, and providing the tools needed to communicate, deliver on requirements, etc.

**GobstonesWeb2** is an open source project aimed at providing a new version of the current environment, with a solid architecture that is understandable, maintainable, and extensible. The **Core Team** is actively engaged in completing a MVP, and holds regular meetings regarding the development of the project every thursday. These meeting are currently not open to the community, but we might held open meetings in the future.

We expect to be able to have a formal committee at some point that meets regularly in the future and to be able to have open meetings where all the community could join.

All community members are welcome to report issues at our [GitHub's organization page](https://github.com/gobstones), and the **Core team** will assess them and determine a priority for the issue.
