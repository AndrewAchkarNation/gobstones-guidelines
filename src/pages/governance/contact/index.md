# Contact us and the community

Depending on the needs and on what do you want to communicate, we have different contact places.

If you want to join other users to exchange comments, information and experiences, you should join the [**Gobstones Community**](http://bit.ly/ComunidadGobstones) server at Discord. The language spoken in the server is mostly spanish, yet all nationalities and languages are welcome.

Also, if you want to talk directly to the development team, you may join the community server, as the team usually hangs there.

If you want to report bugs or issues, you can report them at our [GitHub's organization page](https://github.com/gobstones). You should report them in the appropriate repository, so it would be nice if you are aware of the [project's architecture](../../architecture) in order to do that.
