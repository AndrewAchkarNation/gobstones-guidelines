# Introduction to the **GobstonesWeb2** guidelines

The gobstones-guidelines contain documentation on the platform architecture, design guidelines, ways to contribute, and standards used, related to the development of **GobstonesWeb2**.

There are 4 main sections on the guidelines. Depending on the way you are planning to contribute, you may need to know only some of them, or you may need to know them all.

The sections are the following:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Governance and flow of communication

Project governance provides direction and defines decision making.
Flow of communication guarantees that all contributors are aware of the latest decisions in the project that may affect them.

If you want to contribute in any way, even if it's not coding, you should be aware of everything in this section. So be sure to read the [governance](../governance) section so you can learn how do we work, who are we and how to get in touch with us.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Architecture of **GobstonesWeb2**

The architecture of **GobstonesWeb2** combines several modules providing different functionalities, each module in it's own repository, and with different technologies.

If you are planning on getting deeper into how **GobstonesWeb2** works, and which are the major parts of the system, you should read the [architecture](../architecture) section to know more about all the modules and how they interrelate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technologies used

**GobstonesWeb2** is developed in `Typescript` and we use `Node.js` to develop, along several other technologies associated with those.

If you want to contribute with code in any way, or are planning on downloading and running any of the modules on your own, you should read the [technologies](../technologies) section to learn about the technologies we use and how to use them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Coding standards and workflow

We follow a series of standards when coding and naming elements, and also a specific workflow.
Please, be sure to follow those standards when contributing to the project.

If you want to contribute with code in any way, please note that we do not accept code that does not follow this standards. So be sure to read the [coding standards](../coding-standards) section to learn about how do we code.
