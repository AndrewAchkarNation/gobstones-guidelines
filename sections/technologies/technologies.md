# Technologies used in **GobstonesWeb2**

**GobstonesWeb2** is based on `Node.js`, and `Typescript`, and several technologies associated with those.

## The basics

<!--- ------- --->
<!--- Node.js --->
<!--- ------- --->
In order to contribute to the development, you need to have `Node.js` and some package manager installed in your system, and understand how to use it with a given repository.

If you want to know more on `Node.js` there are a lot of good books and tutorials on it.
A good starting point to know the basics on `Node.js` is [`nodejs.org`](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).

<!--- ------- --->
<!---   npm   --->
<!--- ------- --->
Associated with `Node.js` you will be using some package manager, to help you download, install, and administer all the packages needed for effective development.
The most common package managers is `npm` (Node Package Manager), installed together with `Node.js`, but there are others.

<!--- Typescript --->

Finally, we use `Typescript` for most of the development of new packages.

`Typescript` is a programming language based on `Javascript`, with the addition of types, thus
providing a type error detection mechanism.
A good starting point to know the basics on `Typescript` is [`typescriptlang.org`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

<!--- ------- --->
<!---   VSC   --->
<!--- ------- --->
One important addition for helping on the development is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
Again, there are several ones, but many of us use **Visual Studio Code** (`VSCode`).
