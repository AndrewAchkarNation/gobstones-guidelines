# Technologies used in **GobstonesWeb2**

**GobstonesWeb2** is based on `Node.js`, and `Typescript`, and several technologies associated with those.

## The basics

<!--- ------- --->
<!--- Node.js --->
<!--- ------- --->

### Node.js
In order to contribute to the development, you need to have `Node.js` and some package manager installed in your system, and understand how to use it with a given repository.

If you want to know more on `Node.js` there are a lot of good books and tutorials on it.
A good starting point to know the basics on `Node.js` is [`nodejs.org`](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).

### Packet Manager: `npm`
Associated with `Node.js` you will be using some package manager, to help you download, install, and administer all the packages needed for effective development.
The most common package managers is `npm` (Node Package Manager), installed together with `Node.js`, but there are others.

### Typescript
Finally, we use `Typescript` for most of the development of new packages.

`Typescript` is a programming language based on `Javascript`, with the addition of types, thus
providing a type error detection mechanism.
A good starting point to know the basics on `Typescript` is [`typescriptlang.org`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

<!---   VSC   --->

### Visual Studio Code
One important addition for helping on the development is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
Again, there are several ones, but many of us use **Visual Studio Code** (`VSCode`).

## Other technologies

<!--- ---------- --->
<!---   Rollup   --->
<!--- ---------- --->

### Rollup
As a means to bundle and compile code from the project modules, we rely on `rollup.js`.  This tool is designed for modern JavaScript development applications, focusing on creating efficient and optimized bundles for the web.

<!---     nps    --->
<!--- ---------- --->

### Package Scripts: `nps`
To define and execute custom scripts within `Node.js`, our project uses a `npm` feature called `nps` (Node Package Scripts) which can automate various tasks, such as building, testing, deploying, and more.

<!--- ---------- --->
<!---  Prettier  --->
<!--- ---------- --->

### Prettier
To ensure uniformity in coding style, we integrate the opinionated code formatter `Prettier` to automatically enforce a  standardized set of styling rules.

<!--- ---------- --->
<!---   ESLint   --->
<!--- ---------- --->

### ESLint
In addition to `Prettier` for maintainability of codebase  throughout our project, `ESLint` statically analyzes the code for common errors, stylistic issues, and potential pitfalls, thus providing actionable feedback to fix such problems for both `Javascript` and `Typescript`, ensuring the code's quality and reliability.

### EditorConfig
For more style and formatting consistency, there is also the inclusion of `EditorConfig`, a file format that works across different code editors and IDEs.

<!--- ---------- --->
<!---  TypeDoc   --->
<!--- ---------- --->

### TypeDoc
As a way to generate documentation, the `TypeDoc` tool reads the `TypeScript` source files, parses comments contained within them, and creates API documentation for a more comprehensive and well-structured documentation of the project.

<!---    Jest    --->
<!--- ---------- --->

### Jest
Last but not least, you will be creating, running, and managing test suites with `Jest` testing framework. It works with `TypeScript` code, providing a comprehensive set of tools and features to simplify the process of writing and maintaining tests.
