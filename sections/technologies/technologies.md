# Technologies used in **GobstonesWeb2**

**GobstonesWeb2** is based on `Node.js`, and `Typescript`, and several technologies associated with those.

## The basics

<!--- ------- --->
<!--- Node.js --->
<!--- ------- --->
In order to contribute to the development, you need to have `Node.js` and some package manager installed in your system, and understand how to use it with a given repository.

If you want to know more on `Node.js` there are a lot of good books and tutorials on it.
A good starting point to know the basics on `Node.js` is [`nodejs.org`](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).
</details>

<!--- ------- --->
<!---   npm   --->
<!--- ------- --->
Associated with `Node.js` you will be using some package manager, to help you download, install, and administer all the packages needed for effective development.
The most common package managers is `npm` (Node Package Manager), installed together with `Node.js`, but there are others.

A good starting point to know the basics on `npm` is [`npmjs.com`](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm).

<!--- ---------- --->
<!--- Typescript --->
<!--- ---------- --->
Finally, we use `Typescript` for most of the development of new packages.

`Typescript` is a programming language based on `Javascript`, with the addition of types, thus
providing a type error detection mechanism.
A good starting point to know the basics on `Typescript` is [`typescriptlang.org`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).
</details>

<!--- ------- --->
<!---   VSC   --->
<!--- ------- --->
One important addition for helping on the development is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
Again, there are several ones, but many of us use **Visual Studio Code** (`VSCode`).

## Other technologies

<!--- ---------- --->
<!---   Rollup   --->
<!--- ---------- --->
As a means to bundle and compile code from the project modules, we use `rollup.js` which is designed for modern JavaScript development applications, focusing on creating efficient and optimized bundles for the web.

</details>

---

<!--- ---------- --->
<!---     nps    --->
<!--- ---------- --->
To define and execute custom scripts within `Node.js`, the project uses a `npm` feature called `nps` (Node Package Scripts) which can automate various tasks, such as building, testing, deploying, and more.

<!--- ---------- --->
<!---  Prettier  --->
<!--- ---------- --->
For style consistency, the inclusion of the opinionated code formatter `Prettier` helps to automatically enforce a general set of styling rules.
<details>

A good starting point to know the basics on `Prettier` is [`prettier.io`](https://prettier.io/).
</details>

---

<!--- ---------- --->
<!---   ESLint   --->
<!--- ---------- --->
In addition to `Prettier` for maintainability of codebase, `ESLint` statically analyzes the code for common errors, stylistic issues, and potential pitfalls, thus providing actionable feedback to fix such problems for `Javascript`/`Typescript`.

A good starting point to know the basics on `ESLint` is [`eslint.org`](https://eslint.org/).
</details>

---

<!--- ------------ --->
<!--- EditorConfig --->
<!--- ------------ --->
For more style and formatting consistency, there is also the inclusion of `EditorConfig`, a file format that works across different code editors and IDEs.

A good starting point to know the basics on `EditorConfig` is [`editorconfig.org`](https://editorconfig.org/).
</details>

---

<!--- ---------- --->
<!---  TypeDoc   --->
<!--- ---------- --->
As a way to generate documentation, the `TypeDoc` tool reads the `TypeScript` source files, parses comments contained within them, and creates API documentation for a more comprehensive and well-structured documentation of the project.
<details>

</details>

---

<!--- ---------- --->
<!---    Jest    --->
<!--- ---------- --->
Last but not least, you will be creating, running, and managing test suites with `Jest` testing framework. It works with `TypeScript` code, providing a comprehensive set of tools and features to simplify the process of writing and maintaining tests.
